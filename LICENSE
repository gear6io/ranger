The Business Source License (this document) is a very open license. It has two phases:

1. **Open Phase** (until Change Date): You can use the code under the Apache License, Version 2.0
2. **Commercial Phase** (after Change Date): You must comply with the Business Source License terms

**Current Status**: We are in the Open Phase until 2025-01-01. You can use this code under the Apache License, Version 2.0 until that date.

**After 2025-01-01**: The code will be licensed under the Business Source License, which means:
- You can still use the code for internal purposes
- You can still modify and distribute the code
- You cannot use it to provide a Database Service to third parties
- You cannot use it in a commercial product that competes with gear6io's commercial offerings
