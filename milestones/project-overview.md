# 🚀 Icebox Parquet Storage Project Overview

**Status**: 🚧 In Planning  
**Project Duration**: 8-10 weeks  
**Team Size**: 3-4 developers  
**Priority**: 🔴 High  

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform Icebox from a JSON-based storage system to a fully Apache Iceberg native platform that writes Parquet files on disk with minimal memory usage, proper file rotation, and complete Iceberg compliance.

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### **✅ What's Already Implemented**
- **Apache Iceberg Integration**: Complete catalog system with JSON and SQLite backends
- **Storage Infrastructure**: Multi-engine storage (filesystem, memory, S3) with unified interface
- **Metadata Management**: Production-ready SQLite schema for tracking table metadata
- **Path Management**: Comprehensive path management for tables, metadata, and data
- **Dependencies**: Apache Arrow Go, Apache Iceberg Go, ULID generation

### **❌ What Needs to Be Built**
- **Parquet File Writing**: 0% implemented - currently only JSON storage
- **Apache Iceberg File Format**: 0% implemented - missing snapshots, manifests, proper file structure
- **Memory-Efficient Processing**: 0% implemented - data currently copied to RAM
- **Schema Management**: 0% implemented - no fixed user schemas or validation
- **Performance Optimization**: 0% implemented - no streaming or memory pooling
