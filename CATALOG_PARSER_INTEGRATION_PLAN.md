# Catalog-Parser Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for integrating Icebox's Catalog and Query Parser systems, creating a fully catalog-aware query processing pipeline with pluggable execution paths.

## Phase 1: Adapter Interface & Basic Integration (Current Sprint)
- Create adapter interfaces between parser AST and catalog types
- Implement basic catalog validation during parsing
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Establish foundation for deeper integration

## Phase 2: Full Catalog Awareness
- Table/column existence validation during parsing
- Schema constraint validation
- Data type compatibility checking
- Privilege validation integration

## Phase 3: Pluggable Execution Paths
- Native execution engine (like AriaSQL)
- DuckDB execution engine
- Pluggable engine interface
- Query routing based on statement type and capabilities

## Phase 4: Advanced Schema Management
- DDL execution with catalog updates
- Transaction coordination with WAL
- Schema evolution tracking
- Metadata versioning

## Phase 5: Query Optimization & Planning
- Catalog-aware query planning
- Index selection based on catalog metadata
- Statistics-based optimization
- Cost-based query routing

## Architecture Components

### 1. Adapter Interfaces
```go
type CatalogAdapter interface {
    ValidateTable(tableName string) error
    ValidateColumn(tableName, columnName string) error
    GetTableSchema(tableName string) (*catalog.TableSchema, error)
    ValidateDataType(dataType string) error
}

type ParserCatalogBridge interface {
    ParseWithCatalog(query string, catalog CatalogAdapter) (Node, error)
    ValidateAST(node Node, catalog CatalogAdapter) error
}
```

### 2. Pluggable Execution Engine
```go
type ExecutionEngine interface {
    ExecuteQuery(ctx context.Context, ast Node, catalog CatalogAdapter) (*QueryResult, error)
    SupportsStatement(stmtType string) bool
    GetCapabilities() EngineCapabilities
}

type EngineCapabilities struct {
    SupportsDDL bool
    SupportsDML bool
    SupportsTransactions bool
    SupportsIndexes bool
}
```

### 3. Query Router
```go
type QueryRouter struct {
    engines []ExecutionEngine
    catalog CatalogAdapter
}

func (qr *QueryRouter) RouteAndExecute(query string) (*QueryResult, error)
```

## Implementation Timeline

- [ ] Create adapter interfaces
- [ ] Implement basic catalog validation
- [ ] Update parser to use adapters
- [ ] Basic integration tests

### Week 3-4: Phase 2 (Full Catalog Awareness)
- [ ] Table/column validation
- [ ] Schema constraint validation
- [ ] Data type validation
- [ ] Privilege checking

### Week 5-6: Phase 3 (Pluggable Execution)

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Performance Impact
- Catalog validation overhead during parsing
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed metadata
- Lazy loading of catalog information

### 2. Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when catalog is unavailable
- Detailed error messages for validation failures
- Recovery mechanisms for catalog corruption

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for catalog-parser interaction
- Performance benchmarks
- Chaos testing for catalog failures

### 4. Migration Path
- Backward compatibility during transition
- Gradual rollout of new features
- Rollback mechanisms
- Data migration tools

## Success Metrics

### 1. Functionality
- 100% catalog awareness in query processing
- Zero data type mismatches
- Complete schema validation coverage

### 2. Performance
- <5% parsing overhead increase
- <10% query execution overhead
- Sub-second catalog validation times

### 3. Reliability
- 99.9% uptime during catalog operations
- Zero data corruption incidents
- Graceful error handling

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Technical Risks
- **Catalog lock contention**: Implement read-write locks
- **Parser complexity**: Maintain clean separation of concerns
- **Performance degradation**: Extensive profiling and optimization

### 2. Operational Risks
- **Data loss**: Comprehensive backup strategies
- **Service disruption**: Blue-green deployment approach
- **Rollback complexity**: Maintain backward compatibility

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Features
- Multi-tenant catalog support
- Distributed catalog management
- Real-time schema updates
- Automated schema optimization

### 2. Integration Opportunities
- External catalog systems (Hive, Glue)
- Schema registry integration
- Data lineage tracking
- Compliance reporting

## Conclusion

This integration will transform Icebox from a simple query router to a fully catalog-aware, intelligent query processing system. The phased approach ensures manageable complexity while delivering immediate value through basic integration.
