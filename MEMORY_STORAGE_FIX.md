# Memory Storage Fix

## Problem Identified
The `server/storage/memory/adapter.go` file had a type mismatch issue:

```
server/storage/memory/adapter.go:68:18: fwc.file.Write undefined (type "github.com/apache/iceberg-go/io".File has no field or method Write)
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the adapter design:

1. **`icebergio.File` interface** only supports reading operations:
   - `io.ReadSeekCloser`
   - `io.ReaderAt`
   - No `Write` method

2. **`MemoryFileSystem.Create()`** returns `(io.File, error)` but the actual type is `*memoryWriteFile` which has a `Write` method

3. **Type casting problem**: The adapter was trying to cast the returned file to `icebergio.File` and then call `Write()` on it, but `icebergio.File` doesn't have a `Write` method

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed the Adapter Logic

**Before (Broken):**
```go
// Create creates a new file for writing
func (fsa *FileSystemAdapter) Create(path string) (io.WriteCloser, error) {
    file, err := fsa.mfs.Create(path)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return &fileWriteCloser{file: file}, nil  // ❌ file is icebergio.File (no Write)
}

// fileWriteCloser adapts icebergio.File to io.WriteCloser
type fileWriteCloser struct {
    file icebergio.File  // ❌ icebergio.File has no Write method
}

func (fwc *fileWriteCloser) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
    return fwc.file.Write(p)  // ❌ This fails
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```go
// Create creates a new file for writing
func (fsa *FileSystemAdapter) Create(path string) (io.WriteCloser, error) {
    file, err := fsa.mfs.Create(path)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    // The Create method returns a memoryWriteFile which has Write method
    // We need to cast it to access the Write method
    if writeFile, ok := file.(*memoryWriteFile); ok {
        return &fileWriteCloser{writeFile: writeFile}, nil
    }
    
    return nil, io.ErrShortWrite
}

// fileWriteCloser adapts memoryWriteFile to io.WriteCloser
type fileWriteCloser struct {
    writeFile *memoryWriteFile  // ✅ memoryWriteFile has Write method
}

func (fwc *fileWriteCloser) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
    return fwc.writeFile.Write(p)  // ✅ This works
}
```

## Key Changes

1. **Type Assertion**: Added proper type assertion to cast `io.File` to `*memoryWriteFile`
2. **Correct Field Type**: Changed `file icebergio.File` to `writeFile *memoryWriteFile`
3. **Error Handling**: Added fallback error if type assertion fails

## Why This Happened

The `MemoryFileSystem` implementation uses a different approach than the `icebergio.File` interface:

- **`icebergio.File`**: Read-only interface for Iceberg's file operations
- **`memoryWriteFile`**: Internal type that supports both reading and writing
- **`MemoryFileSystem.Create()`**: Returns `io.File` but the actual type is `*memoryWriteFile`

The adapter needed to bridge this gap by properly handling the type conversion.

## Build Status

✅ **Fixed**: All packages now build successfully
- `go build ./server/storage/memory/...` - Success
- `go build ./server/storage/...` - Success  
- `go build ./server/catalog/...` - Success

## Benefits

1. **Proper Type Safety**: Correct type assertions prevent runtime errors
2. **Full Functionality**: Memory filesystem now supports both read and write operations
3. **Clean Interface**: Adapter properly bridges between different file system interfaces
4. **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation between read-only and write-capable file types

## Usage Example

```go
// Create storage manager with memory filesystem
storage, err := storage.NewManager(&storage.Config{
    Type: "memory",
}, logger)

// Get filesystem and create a file
fs := storage.GetFileSystem()
writer, err := fs.Create("test.txt")  // ✅ Now works correctly
if err != nil {
    return err
}
defer writer.Close()

// Write data
writer.Write([]byte("Hello, World!"))
```
